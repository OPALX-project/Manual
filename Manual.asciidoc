== Preliminary note

This is the manual for _OPAL_ 2.3. Odd minor version numbers identify
development versions. Use these versions only if you know what you are
doing!

New feature might not yet be documented or something is already documented
but not yet implemented.

== Abstract

_OPAL_ is a parallel open source tool for charged-particle optics in linear accelerators and rings, including 3D space charge.
Using the _MAD_ language with extensions, _OPAL_ can run on a laptop as well as on the largest high performance computing systems.
_OPAL_ is built from the ground up as a parallel application exemplifying the fact that high performance computing is the third leg of science, complementing theory and experiment.

The _OPAL_ framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new _C++_ classes.
_OPAL_ comes in the following flavours:

_OPAL-cycl_::
  tracks particles with 3D space charge including neighbouring turns in
  cyclotrons and FFAs with time as the independent variable.
_OPAL-t_::
  models beam lines, linacs, rf-photo injectors and
  complete XFELs excluding the undulator.
_OPAL-map_::
  map tracking (experimental, no space charge yet)

It should be noted that not all features of _OPAL_ are available in all
flavours.
