== Geometry

At present the `GEOMETRY` command is still an *experimental feature*
which is not to be used by the general user. It can only be used to
specify boundaries for the MG Solver. The command can be used in two
modes:

1.  specify a H5Fed file holding the surface mesh of a complicated
boundary geometry
2.  use a predefined geometry: `ELLIPTIC`, `RECTANGULAR` or `BOXCORNER`

[cols="<1,<4",options="header",]
|==============================================================
|Command    |Purpose
|`GEOMETRY` |Specify a geometry
|`FGEOM`    |Specifies the geometry file, an H5Fed file, containing the surface mesh
             of the geometry.
|`LENGTH`   |The length of the specified geometry in [m].
|`TOPO`     |The topology of the geometry: `ELLIPTIC`, `RECTANGULAR` or `BOXCORNER`
|`S`        |The start of the specified geometry in [m].
|`A`        |The semi-major axis of the ellipse or the half aperture
             of the rectangle (horizontally) in [m].
|`B`        |The semi-minor axis of the ellipse or the half aperture
             of the rectangle (vertically) in [m].
|`C`        |The height of the corner in [m]. `BOXCORNER` only.

An example of an elliptic geometry:

The geometry element must later be passed to the link:fieldsolvers#sec.fieldsolvers.fieldsolvercmd[fieldsolver command].
