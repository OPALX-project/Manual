== Geometry

At present the `GEOMETRY` command is still an *experimental feature*
which is not to be used by the general user. It can only be used to
specify boundaries for the MG Solver. The command can be used in two
modes:

1.  specify a H5Fed file holding the surface mesh of a complicated
boundary geometry
2.  use a predefined geometry: `ELLIPTIC`, `RECTANGULAR` or `BOXCORNER`

|==============================================================
|Command        |Purpose                                            |Default Value
|`GEOMETRY`     |Specify a geometry                                 |
|`FGEOM`        |Specifies the geometry file, an H5Fed file,
                 containing the surface mesh of the geometry.       |
|`LENGTH`       |The length of the specified geometry in [m].       |1.0
|`TOPO`         |The topology of the geometry: `ELLIPTIC`,
                 `RECTANGULAR` or `BOXCORNER`.
                 If `FGEOM` is selected `TOPO` is overwritten.      |`ELLIPTIC`
|`S`            |The start of the specified geometry in [m].        |1.0
|`A`            |The semi-major axis of the ellipse or the half
                 aperture of the rectangle (horizontally) in [m].   |0.025
|`B`            |The semi-minor axis of the ellipse or the half
                 aperture of the rectangle (vertically) in [m].     |0.025
|`C`            |The height of the corner in [m]. `BOXCORNER` only. |0.01
|`L1`           |The first part of the geometry with height `B`
                 in [m]. `BOXCORNER` only.                          |0.5
|`L2`           |The second part of the geometry with height
                 `B`-`C` in [m]. `BOXCORNER` only.                  |0.2
|`ZSHIFT`       |Shift in z direction.                              |0.0
|`XYZSCALE`     |Multiplicative scaling factor for coordinates      |1.0
|`XSCALE`       |Multiplicative scaling factor for x-coordinates    |1.0
|`YSCALE`       |Multiplicative scaling factor for y-coordinates    |1.0
|`ZSCALE`       |Multiplicative scaling factor for z-coordinates    |1.0
|`INSIDEPOINT`  |A point inside the geometry                        |
