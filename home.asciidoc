== Abstract

_OPAL_ is a parallel open source tool for charged-particle optics in linear accelerators and rings, including 3D space charge.
Using the MAD language with extensions, OPAL can run on a laptop as well as on the largest high performance computing systems.
OPAL is built from the ground up as a parallel application exemplifying the fact that high performance computing is the third leg of science, complementing theory and experiment.
The OPAL framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new C++ classes. OPAL comes in two flavours:

The _OPAL_ framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of
new _C++_ classes. It comes in the following flavours:

_OPAL-cycl_::
  tracks particles with 3D space charge including neighbouring turns in
  cyclotrons and FFAs with time as the independent variable.
_OPAL-t_::
  can be used to model beam lines, linacs, rf-photo injectors and
  complete XFELs excluding the undulator.
_OPAL-map_::
  map tracking (experimental, no space charge yet)

It should be noted that not all features of _OPAL_ are available in all
flavours.
